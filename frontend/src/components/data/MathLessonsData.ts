      intro: "We use numbers everywhere in our daily lives. ",
      explanation: `1. What are Numbers?
      Numbers are symbols we use to count, measure, or label things.
      We use numbers in everyday life to tell how many things we have or how old we are.
      2. Counting Numbers (1-10):

      Start with 1 and keep adding one more each time: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
      This is called counting.
      3. Writing Numbers:

      Numbers are written as symbols. For example:
      One is written as 1.
      Two is written as 2.
      Three is written as 3.
      And so on!
      4. Number Order:

      Numbers have a special order. The number after 1 is 2, after 2 is 3, and so on.
      This helps us to count and keep track of things.
      5. Simple Addition:

      Addition means putting things together.
      Example:
      1 + 1 = 2 (One plus one equals two).
      6. Simple Subtraction:

      Subtraction means taking things away.
      Example:
      3 - 1 = 2 (Three minus one equals two).
      7. Numbers Around Us:

      Numbers are everywhere: on clocks, in books, on doors, and even in our phones!
      Activity:
      Try counting from 1 to 10 aloud.
      Look around you and try to find things to countâ€”how many toys, pencils, or buttons do you see?
      Remember, numbers help us understand and organize the world around us!`,
